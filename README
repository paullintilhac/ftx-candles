In order to run this code, you need postgres installed

Once installed, setup the database and table by running the shell script ./setup-postgres.sh

Then, you can run `python3 update-then-stream.py`, which will fetch all data since the default start date in the three resoutions given, and up to the current date. After that, it will start the streaming process. 

In order to view the table of diffs, you can either use the query in the postgresconnection class, or you can stop the streaming process and then run update-then-stream.py again, in which case it will auto-update the diff table.
